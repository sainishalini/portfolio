  <h1>Short Bio</h1>
  
  <p>Dr. Shalini Saini earned her Ph.D. in Computer Science from Texas A&M University and an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Alabama. She is currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES). Before joining UMES, she served as an Assistant Research Scientist at Texas A&M University–Central Texas (TAMUCT), where her research focused on Cybersecurity, particularly leveraging Machine Learning and Deep Learning for network intrusion detection and defense. Dr. Saini also served as an Adjunct Faculty member in Computer Information Systems at TAMUCT.
Her research extends to privacy and security challenges in emerging healthcare technologies. Her work has identified critical vulnerabilities related to data integrity in medical AI solutions, privacy leaks in healthcare mobile apps, and breach of voice anonymity in the era of telemedicine. During her M.S. thesis at the University of Alabama, she uncovered network security threats to the GENI prototype, ProtoGENI.</p>
  <p>Her research contributions have been published in peer-reviewed venues such as IEEE, ACM, CHIL, and Springer US. <br/> 
She was a recipient of the 2019-2020 Graduate Fellowship at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Before her doctoral studies, she worked as a Senior Systems Analyst at UAB’s Department of Medicine IT, supporting hundreds of research projects, including R01- and NIH-funded studies, while ensuring compliance with HIPAA, IRB, and institutional/federal security regulations.
